# TSA Data Patterns and Update Logic

## Data Sources
- Historical data (2019-previous year): https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/YYYY
- Current year data: https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes

## Update Patterns
The [tsa_scraper.py](mdc:tsa_scraper.py) follows these rules:
1. For historical years: Data is relatively static, full download
2. For current year: 
   - Checks existing file
   - Only updates with new/changed data
   - Preserves historical records

## Data Format
CSV files follow this structure:
```
Date,Passengers
MM/DD/YYYY,NUMBER
```
- Dates are parsed using datetime.strptime with '%m/%d/%Y' format
- Passenger numbers are stored as integers
- No header row in source table, added during processing
